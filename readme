Currently this bot will:
- follow back
- follow new users
- retweet people who it follows
- tweet and retweet about interests and current trends
- fave tweets from search and friends

To do:
- make time intervals and perturbations all easily set in config
- fave, RT or respond to @mentions
- remove dichotomy between bools and distributions
- put logging in a queue for better cross-prosses output
- make time-of-day tweet time offset more of a bell curve
- clean things up / document
- catch "already faved/retweeted" errors
